# üìâ Stop the Churn (DS-2)

## üìù Project Overview

Customer churn is a key metric for businesses in subscription-based services. The goal of this project is to **predict whether a customer is likely to churn** (i.e., stop using the service), so that retention strategies can be deployed effectively.

This machine learning classification project uses historical customer data to train a model and generate actionable insights via a visual dashboard.
